> **The future of Blender node sharing starts here.** Introducing the `.node` format—a revolutionary way to package, share, and distribute Geometry Node groups across the Blender community.

---

## 🚀 The Future is `.node`

The `.node` format represents the next evolution in Blender workflow efficiency. Instead of complex append operations or manual node group transfers, the community can now share node groups as simple, portable `.node` files.

### Why `.node` is the Future

- **🎯 One-Click Import**: Drag and drop `.node` files directly into Blender
- **📦 Complete Packaging**: All node data, connections, and metadata in one file
- **🔄 Version Control Ready**: Perfect for Git workflows and collaborative projects
- **🌐 Community Standard**: Establish a unified format for the entire Blender ecosystem
- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: No more hunting through blend files—instant access to node groups
